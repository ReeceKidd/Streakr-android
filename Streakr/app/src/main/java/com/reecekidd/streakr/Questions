1) What is the proper way to organise a strings.xml file?
2) Am I switching to different activities using intents the correct way?
3) How should a network call be made correctly?
4) Is is ok that everything is a constraint layout?
5) Can we do a general audit of the project to point out what needs to be improved please.
6) Is it a good practice to name the strings in the strings.xml like I have "do_you_want_to_set_a_forfeit" etc.
7) Is there supposed to be a class that is responsible for what activity is fired next, a prime example being in the createStreak screen or is this just handled through if statements.
8) Is this the correct way to handle an undefined Json Web Token?

val sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences(
                getString(R.string.shared_preferences_api_key), Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
        val jsonWebToken = sharedPreferences.getString(getString(R.string.json_web_token), null)
        if(jsonWebToken != null && jsonWebToken.isNotEmpty()){
            Log.d(tag, "jsonWebToken is not empty")
            // Need to verify this token with the server.

            val homeAcvitityIntent = Intent(this.applicationContext, HomeActivity::class.java)
            this.applicationContext.startActivity(homeAcvitityIntent)
            return
        }
