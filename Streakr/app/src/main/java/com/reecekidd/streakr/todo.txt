09/04/2019 - Need to fix unit tests and intergration now that {users: } is being used to return users.

                Finish the addFriend call. - Continue work on passng context, userId down to the recycler view rows so they can
                make the network call correctly. Need to figure out how to make a class to handle the network calls. And a class
                to get the operating userId from the JSON web token to do this correctly.

                then change the appearance of the text and that friend logo.
                Implement get friends route
                Create streak logic on the servern
                Create logout option.

Continue work intergrting agenda, get robo3t set up correctly
to work with DB.
